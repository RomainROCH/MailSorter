## Development Philosophy

### Human-Directed & AI-Implemented

MailSorter follows a **"Glass Box"** development philosophy:

- **Human Direction**: All architectural decisions, security policies, and feature specifications are authored by Romain ROCH.
- **AI Implementation**: Code implementation leverages AI-assisted development tools under human supervision and review.
- **Transparent by Design**: The source code is public so that users and security researchers can verify exactly what the software does.

This approach combines human judgment and accountability with the productivity benefits of modern AI tools.
