# MailSorter - Archived

This project demonstrated the limitations of the Thunderbird market for LLM-powered tools. Giants like Gmail + Gemini and Outlook + Copilot have solved the problem more effectively for 95% of users.

MailSorter remains quality code if someone wants to fork it.
However, I'm focusing on projects with greater user impact.
